Benchmark results are spread across papers, repositories, and follow-up runs.
The Ranking Explorer is a static, classification-only comparison of frozen
geospatial foundation models under one evaluation protocol. It is intended as a
shared, inspectable record that the community can use to converge on reliable
performance information—not a declaration of a final winner.

Rankings are summaries: choose how datasets are combined, then choose the probe
and input bands whose results are being summarized. Task remains visible and is
disabled until a build includes more than classification. If a result is wrong,
missing, or implausible, please `open an issue
<https://github.com/torchgeo/torchgeo-bench/issues>`__ with the model, view,
and any supporting evidence. General feedback is welcome too.

The aggregation choices answer different questions:

* **Average rank** ranks models within every dataset and averages those
  positions. Score gaps do not matter, so different score ranges do not
  dominate; 1 is best.
* **ELO** summarizes head-to-head wins from every dataset in one rating. Its
  displayed interval is a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval; higher is
  better.
* **Improvability** is the share of remaining error a model must remove to tie
  the best model on each dataset, averaged across datasets; 0 is best.

The fixed methodology and coverage rules are:

* All rows use patch-mean features.
* A model is ranked only with a complete row across the eligible datasets in
  its ``(task, probe, bands)`` view.
* The generator uses complete ``model_native`` results when available and
  otherwise uses complete ``bandspec_zscore`` results; it never combines the
  two.
* Models without a complete row are named below the table.

The GFLOPs chart directly below the table pairs positive, measured 224-pixel
backbone GFLOPs with the selected aggregation. It labels the displayed models
and places their names to avoid collisions where possible. Both axis titles
carry their own direction, so the vertical axis reads ``Worse ←`` to
``→ Better`` and the horizontal axis reads ``Less compute ←`` to
``→ More compute``. Zero or unmeasured values are omitted from the log-scale
plot and listed below it.

The final rank-sensitivity heatmap is a fixed Average-rank overview of all
available views. Every cell first finds the models present in both views, then
re-ranks those shared models using each view's *full* dataset set before
calculating tie-aware Kendall τ-b. Thus, values near +1 mean that two views
produce the same ordering, 0 means little ordering agreement, and -1 means a
reversal. The row and column labels identify the compared views; each cell also
reports its shared-model count and both dataset counts, and a dagger marks a
small shared roster.

The hand-edited source is
:file:`experiments/scripts/ranking_explorer.template.html`. The generator
reads its empty JSON anchors and writes the self-contained documentation asset:

.. code-block:: console

   python experiments/scripts/regen_leaderboard.py

Use ``--template`` and ``--html`` to render a synthetic template/output pair
in tests. Do not hand-edit :file:`docs/_static/ranking_explorer.html`.
