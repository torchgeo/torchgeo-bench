"""SAM3 image encoder wrapper for torchgeo-bench.

Uses SAM3's ViT-H vision encoder (with built-in FPN neck) as a frozen backbone
for dense segmentation probing. Only RGB (3-channel) input is supported.

Each ``Sam3ViTLayer`` bakes its RoPE grid into buffers at construction from
``config.image_size // config.patch_size``, so the input resolution is fixed
when the model is built and cannot change per forward pass.  The absolute
position embeddings are sized from ``pretrain_image_size`` instead and tiled
dynamically at forward time, so overriding ``image_size`` causes no weight-shape
conflict on load.

Checkpoint:
    Defaults to the Hub repo ``facebook/sam3``, which is gated: accept the terms
    on the model page and authenticate (``hf auth login``) once, after which the
    weights download into the standard HuggingFace cache automatically.  Set
    ``checkpoint_path`` to load from a local HuggingFace-format directory
    (``model.safetensors`` + ``config.json``) instead.

    ``facebook/sam3.1`` is deliberately *not* used: it ships only an
    original-format ``.pt`` with no transformers integration, and its Object
    Multiplex speedup applies to multi-object video tracking, which this
    encoder-only wrapper never runs.

Layer naming for SegmentationProbe:
    The FPN neck produces 4 multi-scale feature maps, each with 256 channels.
    Their spatial dimensions scale with the input resolution
    (``scale_factors = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5]``):
        neck.fpn_layers.3 — coarsest (scale 0.5x)
        neck.fpn_layers.2 — medium   (scale 1x)
        neck.fpn_layers.1 — fine     (scale 2x)
        neck.fpn_layers.0 — finest   (scale 4x)
    Use coarse-to-fine order for FPN/DPT heads.
